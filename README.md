# Pandastagram

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-javascript-final-project)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview
Pandastagram is a photo sharing web app, inspired by Instagram, created for the final project of the Odin Project Javascript curriculum. The main objective of the final project was to replicate a website (Instagram) implementing skills learned with ReactJS and Firebase. Additional techniques learned during this project included uploading img files, cropping images, and utilizing regular expressions for username validation.
